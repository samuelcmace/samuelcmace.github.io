ようこそ！

My name is Samuel Mace. I am currently a student at the University of Wisconsin &ndash; Green Bay seeking a bachelor's
degree in Computer Science. I am interested in learning new technologies and applying them to real-world use cases in
industry. When I am not busy learning about technology, I can be found traveling and studying the Japanese language.

I created this website both to showcase my skills to potential employers and to educate the wider community about
my findings in the field. I enjoy learning new technologies and may share them here from time-to-time.
