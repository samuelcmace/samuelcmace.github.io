ようこそ！

My name is Samuel Mace. I am currently a student at the University of Wisconsin–Green Bay, pursuing a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. I am in the final stages of completing my degree and am actively seeking positions that will allow me to apply what I have learned to real-world use cases in industry. I will be open to full-time work opportunities starting in January 2026.

Recently, I had the amazing opportunity to complete an internship with an international nonprofit in Southeast Asia. This experience was both professionally and culturally rewarding, as it allowed me to work cross-culturally in an international context. As I enter the more serious stages of my job search, I am actively seeking positions that will allow me to continue building on this cross-cultural experience. While I am focusing my job search in Tokyo due to my current level of Japanese proficiency, I am also open to opportunities across Asia if they align well with my skills and experience.
