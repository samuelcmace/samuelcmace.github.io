From my formal education at Northeast Wisconsin Technical College, I have had the opportunity to participate in both
solo and group coding projects to apply the skills that I have learned. Listed below are some of the projects that I
have worked on.

# RestaurantBuddy &ndash; Capstone Project

- [Source Code &ndash; Mobile App](https://github.com/restaurantbuddy/restaurantbuddy-android)

As a capstone project to complete my Software Developer Associate program at Northeast Wisconsin Technical College, I
had the opportunity to piece together a large software application. For this task, I chose the Spring Boot framework so
that I could refine my skills in the Java programming language. This project taught me the Spring MVC architecture for
REST API design, the Spring Security framework for JWT Token Authentication and Authorization, as well as the Spring
Data JPA for database access in large database-driven applications. I was able to code the frontend in JavaScript,
making AJAX calls to the backend to fetch information as needed.

As part of a separate class, I created an Android application using Kotlin to interface with the customer portion of the
API that I completed as part of my capstone. By completing this mobile application, I learned the basics of activity and
fragment navigation, UI components, Firebase and REST API integration, database access using Room, as well as location
detection and the Google Maps API.

# Understanding the Kanji

As a final project for my Java class, I decided to create a language learning app to help me study Japanese. One aspect
of learning Japanese that many students find difficult is the apparent lack of meaning in the Kanji characters, one of
the writing systems used in Japanese. To learn Kanji, I am following [James Heisig's Remembering the
Kanji](https://www.amazon.com/Remembering-Kanji-Complete-Japanese-Characters/dp/0824835921). The study method used in
this curriculum requires the user to take notes on and form stories on the Kanji characters. This app helped me to
accomplish this goal, all while learning about Java app development and database connections in Java.

While the other projects that I have completed have been more one-off in nature, I have been contributing and pushing
changes to this codebase well after I submitted the project for evaluation to my instructor. Some features that I have
added include dark theme support, custom database file location, web browser links, and cross-platform support.

# Battleship Project (Group-work)

- [Project Website](https://c-sharp-battleship.github.io/)

For my second C# class, I was assigned to a team to work on a recreation of the Battleship board game. Although the
project quality was far from perfect, we did end up with a fully-working game in the end (even with experimental
features). More importantly, my team learned the importance of good communication in a team setting (specifically design
patterns) and the importance of good team collaboration software (such as the git version control system, for example).

# Discover the States

- [Live Demo](https://samuelcmace.net/travel/march-2022-road-trip/)

For my final project in my website coding class, I was assigned the task to create a multiple-page website that would
incorporate multimedia content. Since at the time, I was piecing together some road trip footage and posting these
videos on YouTube, I decided to create a website to showcase these videos.
