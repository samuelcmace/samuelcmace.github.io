                <h3>California Facts</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>California is home to the “Avocado Capital of the World.” Every year, Fallbrook holds an avocado festival to celebrate.</li>
                    <li>The Hollywood Bowl is the largest outdoor amphitheater in the United States. When it opened in 1922, it was merely a simple wooden platform with a canvas top!</li>
                    <li>In 1964, San Francisco's cable cars were named the first moving National Historic Landmark. The San Francisco cable cars are the only ones still operating in a U.S city.</li>
                    <li>Wondering what the name of the world's largest tree is? It's General Sherman, and it lives in Sequoia National Park! At nearly 275 feet tall and a circumference of 102 feet, it's certainly a large tree!</li>
                    <li>Death Valley is the hottest, driest AND lowest National Park in the country! Despite its morbid name, due to these extremes, a great diversity of life lives within this park.</li>
                    <li>Bet you know someone who lives in California! As the most populous state in the U.S., 1 in 8 residents live there!</li>
                    <li>California is the birthplace of the internet. In 1969, the first ARPANET message was sent from a UCLA site. (That first message? “Lo”. He meant to say “Login” but….then the system crashed.)</li>
                    <li>Thousands of visitors flock to the Golden Gate Bridge every year, but it wasn't always so beloved. Many originally derided the design as ugly!</li>
                </ul>
