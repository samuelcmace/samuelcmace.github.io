My interest in technology began when I was still a homeschool student. As someone who had family mentors in the field, I
have had the opportunity to study IT and software development at a young age. Over time, I learned the basics of Linux,
C++, and frontend web development. In my formal education at Northeast Wisconsin Technical College, I had the
opportunity to study database administration, backend web development, desktop application development, and mobile
Android application development. As a student at the University of Wisconsin &ndash; Green Bay, I am actively expanding
my knowledge of languages, frameworks, and the underlying theory that makes them work.

Through my experiences both inside and outside the classroom, I have had the opportunity to learn many programming
languages and frameworks, as well as create projects with some of them. Listed below are just some of the programming
languages, frameworks, and tools that I have been able to work with over the years.

## Programming Languages

Throughout the course of my education, I have had the opportunity to work with several programming languages. Some of
these languages are more object-oriented in nature and are suitable for building larger applications, while others are
designed meant for use in scripting and automation.

### Object Oriented

- Java
- Kotlin
- C#
- C/C++
- Python

### Scripting Languages

- Bash
- PowerShell
- SQL (TSQL)

## Frameworks

Throughout the course of my education, I have had the opportunity to work with many different web, desktop, and mobile
application development frameworks.

### Backend Web Development

- ASP.NET (MVC)
- Spring Boot (MVC)
- Java EE (Servlet Design Pattern)

### Frontend Web Development

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6)
- BootStrap (5)

### Desktop Application Development

- Java
    - JavaFX
- C#
    - WPF
    - WinForms
- C++
    - Qt

### Mobile Application Development

- Native Android Apps using Kotlin

## Tools and Platforms

In addition to my programming experience, I have had the opportunity to play around with several different tools and
frameworks designed to facilitate automation in the application development process. As an active DevOps intern, this is
an area that I am actively growing in.

- Containerization Platforms
    - Docker
    - Podman
- GitHub Actions
- Documentation Tools
    - Jekyll
    - DocFX
    - Doxygen
