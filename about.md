My interest in technology began when I was still a homeschool student. As someone who had family mentors in the field, I have had the opportunity to study IT and software development at a young age. Over time, I learned the basics of Linux, C++, and frontend web development. In my formal education at Northeast Wisconsin Technical College, I had the opportunity to study database administration, backend web development, desktop application development, and mobile Android application development. As a student at the University of Wisconsin â€“ Green Bay, I am actively expanding my knowledge of languages, frameworks, and the underlying theory that makes them work.

Through my experiences both inside and outside the classroom, I have had the opportunity to learn many programming languages and frameworks, as well as create projects with some of them. Listed below are just some of the programming languages, frameworks, and tools that I have been able to work with over the years.

Something that I especially enjoy about the field of software engineering and what made me interested in the field is that with the right time, skills, and motivation, one can create amazing products and solutions seemingly out of thin air. Although my passion/focus is more on platform engineering and backend development, I am also eager to learn more about frontend and mobile application development.
